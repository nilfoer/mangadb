- update func in MangaDB(not just webgui)(select fields to overwrite/update 
    always adding/updating ext_info), rlimi+offset search
- thread/subprocess for network stuff
- resize imgs to 400px width but crop too wide imgs
    (original height / original width) x new width = new height
- check for dupl urls/idonpage when adding extinfo! + give warning when importing and idonpage is duplicate?
- safeguard against external link now linking to a different manga when updating!
- triggers for last_change incomplete replace with manual way
- webGUI: mb dont immediately load assoc col when importing from row -> webGUI displays a lot of entries and doesnt need the cols
- create indices for Tags.name, Category.name etc.?
- check newly added books for dl (on production db)
- test triggers
- mb add parent_id field so a chapter/volume can be attributed to a larger book
    also works rn with collection but might spam the display if there are too many chapters+books in a collection
- tests

       
--CANCELED-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- mb switch to only ids when adding/removing joined col values from webGUI
    => NO since i need the names, because users are able to add new ones
        but mb switch later to add ALL the values using the names and then add them in bridge table with ids
        but prob not worth it
- change to sets for joined cols -> POSTPONED till it gets too slow
- there shouldnt be duplicate tags in the sense of e.g. "Demong Girl | Succubus" and "Succubus",
    since its impractical for searching
    -> convert site tags to MangaDB tags
    => let user handle this (they can import the tags and then change them if they dont want duplicates etc.)    
- add ext to edit_info?
        -> no want to keep editing book and external links separate
