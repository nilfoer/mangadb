- there shouldnt be duplicate tags in the sense of e.g. "Demong Girl | Succubus" and "Succubus",
    since its impractical for searching
    -> convert site tags to MangaDB tags
- log adding tags or rather lists
    mb also log title/id_onpage+site since id doesnt help me much when db has crashed and its prob a diff id
- logging in webGUI  
- mb replace "tsumino.com" with a nr or mb foreign key of diff table since for 2700~ entries it incread the size by 1.5MB

--DONE-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- some collections have a "," in their name e.g. Anyway, I Want to Have Sex With...
    => need to either escape the comma or use a different seperator
- fix booktags missing in production db:
    reason not found yet but since ive used the db recently and it crashes instanly when viewing a book using the webGUI
    its likely that it happened when i edited the DB with SQLiteDatabaseBrowser and not when using my code
    all bookid had been deleted from bridge table BookTags except for entries whoms id didnt exist in Tsumino table anymore
        get url, dled, favorite from corrupt db only when id > last addition of 2018-07-10 backup -> 2274 (first add is 2275)
            -> added-books-since-last-valid-backup_all cols_2018-09-23.csv
            -> added-books-since-last-valid-backup_url,dl,fav_2018-09-23.csv
        use log lines with:
            2018-07-10 22:37:32,145 - manga-db  - INFO   - Setting tags for "http://www.tsumino.com/Book/Info/41160/mama-sho-time-dream-express"! Previous tags were: ['li_to-read']
            2018-07-10 22:37:37,587 - manga-db  - INFO   - The following lists were selected ['li_to-read', 'li_prob-good']
        to add more than standard list (which also can be seen from previously selected part)    
        also look out for: 2018-07-10 23:43:09,664 - manga-db  - INFO   - Tried to add book with title that was already in DB: ALICE INN
            -> all additions since last valid bu with only "li_to-read"
        adding of tags not logged but
            20:12:08 - INFO - Tags set() were successfully removed from book with id "2247"
            means that tags were added or removed -> empty set removed only added tags
